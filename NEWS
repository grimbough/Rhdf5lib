Version 1.26
=============

Bug fixes:

  o Updated parts of the bundled HDF5 configure scripts (config.guess &
  config.sub) which were very old and didn't recognise Apple arm64 systems
  when running R installed via conda. (Thanks to @eyalbenda for reporting, 
  https://github.com/grimbough/Rhdf5lib/issues/54)  Backported to 
  Rhdf5lib version 1.24.2

  
Version 1.24
=============

Bug fixes:

  o Fixed compilation issue when there was a space in the library path.
  (thanks to Pius Martinn @albert180 for reporting this, 
  https://github.com/grimbough/rhdf5/issues/128)
  o The configure script now detect the AR and RANLIB associated with R.
  This fixes an issue installing the package from source when using R 
  provided by conda.
  (thanks to Jim Jeffers @jimjeffers for reporting this,
  https://github.com/grimbough/Rhdf5lib/issues/52)

Version 1.22
=============

User visible changes:

  o Removed pre-compiled library for 32-bit Windows as this platform is no
  longer supported by R.

Version 1.20
=============

Bug fixes:

  o Installation on a system with an existing SZIP library would lead to an
  empty linking location when linking against the package. This could cause
  downstream compilation problems on some systems.
  (thanks to @brgew for reporting and Philippe Bordron @bordron for helpful
  diagnostics https://github.com/grimbough/rhdf5/issues/109)
  o Fixed problem where, on some systems, the AEC library would be installed
  to a directory named 'lib64' rather than 'lib' as expected by the package 
  Makevars 
  (thanks to Robby Engelmann @robby81 for reporting this, 
  https://github.com/grimbough/Rhdf5lib/issues/44)

Version 1.18
=============

New features:
  
  o Package now includes precompiled libraries for Windows built with the
  UCRT toolchain for R-4.2
  o Swap bundled version of SZIP for LIBAEC.  This now reflects the official 
  HDF5 group releases.
  o The HDF5 configure option "--disable-sharedlib-rpath" is now exposed during
  package installation
  (thanks to Ben Fulton @benfulton, 
  https://github.com/grimbough/Rhdf5lib/pull/39)
  

Version 1.16
=============

Bug fixes:
  
  o AR and RANLIB programs used to compile R are now also used to compile
  the HDF5 library. This resolves issue when the default versions found on a
  system are incompatible with options used to build R.
  (thanks to @miesav, https://github.com/grimbough/Rhdf5lib/pull/41)
  o Fixed issue in Windows installation introduced by upstream changes
  to libcurl distributed by rwinlibs.
  (https://github.com/grimbough/Rhdf5lib/pull/42)

Version 1.14
=============

New features:

  o Updated internal version of HDF5 to 1.10.7

Bug fixes:
  
  o CPPFLAGS used to build R are now used during HDF compilation.
  o Package configure script will now stop if it encounters errors when 
  compiling HDF5.  This should make diagnosing issues easier.

Version 1.8
=============

New features:

  o Updated internal version of HDF5 to 1.10.5

Bug fixes:
  
  o Quote paths reported by pkgconfig() to allow installation in libraries 
  with whitespace in the path.
  
Version 1.0
=============

New features:

  o Updated internal version of HDF5 to 1.8.19

Bug fixes:
  
  o Switched Windows compilation script to use CMake rather than configure.
  This seems to have solved problems in opening multiple files using different
  access modes.

Version 0.99
=============

  o Package submitted
